The RARU architecture is designed to bridge the gap between discrete digital LSTMs and continuous-time Photonic Computing. By utilizing Ramanujan-Zeta renormalization, we simulate the phase-stability required for infinite-depth optical recursion. If the mathematical terminology is unfamiliar, I recommend looking into Non-Linear Optical Signal Processing.

cheers to you discord mods who banned me ;) teach your community what photonic mathematics are before attempting to critique my work.
